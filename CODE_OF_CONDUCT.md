# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a friendly experience for everyone, regardless of any experience
to give everyone an opportunity to contribute in this project.

## Our Responsibilities

The primary responsibility of contributors is to provide high-quality code contributions to the project. This involves writing, reviewing, and submitting code changes that improve the project's functionality, fix bugs, or implement new features.

Contributors should actively participate in project discussions and communicate effectively with other contributors, maintainers, and users. Contributors should be respectful of others when commenting on issues and pull requests, as well as when interacting with other community members in any other forum.

Contributors can play a role in the long-term maintenance of the project by actively monitoring the project's issue tracker, addressing bug reports and feature requests, and collaborating with other contributors to ensure the project remains healthy and sustainable.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
